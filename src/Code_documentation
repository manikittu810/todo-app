understanding the react components 
First component is typically loaded in React Apps : App component

parts of a component : 
1.view (JSX or Javascript)
2.Logic(JavaScript)
3.Styling(CSS)
4.State(Internal DataStore)
5.Props(Pass Data)
6.Remenber always start Recat Component name with a Capital Letter.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

State in React : 
Built-in react object used to contain data or information about the component.


Hooks are very to use
useState hook allows adding state to Function Components.

JSX is more stricter than HTML, it expects you to have closing tags.

you can also make use of empty wrapper like <> </>

always use () while returning the Components.

always use UpperCase for the Component Names. like 
function FunctionName(){
<!-- Some code -->
}

in JSX always put class as className='' in jsx

you can edit the css component by using the className , in css file use the className by using :
.App{
    <!-- write some css code -->
}
